The entire project is written on vsCode, compiled and debugged using GNU G++ 17.

A basic tutorial of how to operate the program:
1) run the mainCode.cpp file.
2) There are 3 library files, "library1.txt" for example.
3) Each library begins with a line including the username and password of the librarian (for library1 it is username Amon Gus and password -48).
4) Follow the interface towards your desired goal from the program.
5) In case you want to reset the program's database for further testing, use the Library 1 backup file "Library1Backup.txt".
6) As for user database, it also has its own backup file in case a reset for the database is needed.
